# Hack-A-Web Problem Statement - 3

Auctioning is one of the most prominent activities in this world, but due to more virtual events, not all auctions
can occur offline; hence, there is a need to make auctions available virtually, which will be more user-friendly and easier
to use. 

# Solution 

- All user can NOMINATE Items for Auction
- Admin Manager will approve by providing specified date
- Admin Manager will start the auction for the day.
- Buyers can participate in the started auctions
- The Bidding Mechanism is in RealTime. 
 * Updating of Bidding Amount at low latency
 * as, any bid is placed the TIMMER reset's
 * at the end to TIMMER the higgest BIDDER wins the Auction

# Secure System

- All the Images of the Auction is stored in IPFS-network
- All the payment transactions are done in ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN
- Once the item is sold the record get's written in the BlockChain 
 * providing an unalterable selling records.
 * and safe payment methods by Smart Contract to remove Frauds. 
    
# Admin Functionalities

- Admin can approve and activate the product for Auction
- Admin can monitor the products
