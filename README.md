Auctioning is one of the most prominent activities in this world, but due to more virtual events, not all auctions
can occur offline; hence, there is a need to make auctions available virtually, which will be more user-friendly and easier
to use. So, in context of the above issue mentioned we have created a prototype to solve this issue. You can create an account as a buyer or seller and participate in the auction.
